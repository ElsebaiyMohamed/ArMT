    "1) What is existing sloution for the task in specific language?\n",
    "2) Are the same technique or model can work accros deffrent language and dilactes?\n",
    "3) Why specific models work well on specific group of lanauge and performs baddly?\n",
    "4) Where is the problem? because of language design or model structure or wrong assumption or i missunderstood part of the problem and sloution?\n",
    "5) Are there work on research or industry overcome this problems?\n",
